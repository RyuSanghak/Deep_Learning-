* DogOrCat: Dog and Cat image classification model 
// Create a dataset
	- use collected image data including dogs and cats. 
	- image data called by tf.keras function, "tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory()"
	- This function do call the folders with directory path. Even if there are many folders by specific names at the path, they divide into class_names.
	- Called data are splited into training_dataset and valiation_dataset. 8:2
BATCH_SIZE = 64
IMG_HEIGHT = 224
IMG_WIDTH = 224

// batch_size was 32, but the model couldn't classify the images correctly. So increased to 64

// I referred the model layers by TensorFlow sample document.

The model could classify between dogs and cats with a fairly accuracy, but it didn't achieve perfect classification for all images. it might needs learning with a larger dataset or should be changed layers setting.
